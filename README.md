Multi-class classification with INaturalist dataset from torchvision.datasets using 2021_train_mini version. Training with torchvision.models.mobilenet_v3_large model with default weights. The layers are trainable, meaning requires_grad is true for all the layers. 


INaturalist_Mini_10_Class_Classification.ipynb is for experiments using 10 classes from the dataset to see what works or not.
